Detects movements and shows their position in static squares

It detects movements with respect to previous image then shows these movements in pre-defined static squares.

-Threshold and pre-defined squares will be adjustable soon.

*Object finding methods are not used(ai-machine-deep etc.learning or sliding window etc.) Just pure movement.
